RAG metrics
Also about Running the  RAG Metrics using LangChain and connecting to a vectorDatabase Called VectorDB.

Learnt about RAG metrics Such as:
1) Context Relevancy : Extracted revelant Sentences / Total senctences In context i.e (Query / VectorDatabase Context)
2) Context Recall: We give a set of Evaluation Questions and also a " Ground Truth Answers"
   Measure of Context Recall: GroundTruth Sentences attributed to Context / Statements In Ground Truth
3) Context Precision : Are Revelant Context are true Facts or not?
   Precision : True +ves / (True +ves + Flase +ves)
   Measure of Conext Precision : Sum of Precisions/ Total Relevant items in the Top K results

4) Faithfulness: Are the Answers Getting True or not.
5) Answers Revelancy : Generate a Question for the Given Answer.

 Flow Chart for Answer Revelancy.
 QUestion -> Answer Generated ( Low Answer Revelance) -> Asking Question to the Generated Answer -> Compute a Embedding for Generated Question -> Calculate Cosine Similarity or Cosine Score Between the Generated Questions and Orginial Question -> High Revelance Answer.

# RAG Metrics: Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. To assess the performance of RAG systems, several key metrics are employed:

## 1. Context Relevancy

**Definition**: Measures the proportion of relevant sentences in the retrieved context.

**Formula**: (Extracted relevant sentences) / (Total sentences in context)

**Process**:
1. Analyze the query and retrieved context from the vector database.
2. Identify relevant sentences within the context.
3. Calculate the ratio of relevant sentences to total sentences.

## 2. Context Recall

**Definition**: Evaluates how well the retrieved context covers the ground truth information.

**Formula**: (Ground truth sentences attributed to context) / (Total statements in ground truth)

**Process**:
1. Prepare a set of evaluation questions with corresponding ground truth answers.
2. Compare the retrieved context with the ground truth.
3. Calculate the proportion of ground truth information present in the context.

## 3. Context Precision

**Definition**: Assesses the accuracy of the relevant context retrieved.

**Formula**: Sum of precisions / Total relevant items in the top K results

Where precision for each item = (True positives) / (True positives + False positives)

**Process**:
1. Evaluate the top K retrieved results.
2. Determine true and false positives for each result.
3. Calculate precision for each relevant item.
4. Compute the average precision across all relevant items.

## 4. Faithfulness

**Definition**: Measures the truthfulness of the generated answers relative to the provided context.

**Process**:
1. Generate answers based on the retrieved context.
2. Compare the generated answers with the context for factual consistency.
3. Assess the degree to which the answers accurately reflect the information in the context.

## 5. Answer Relevancy

**Definition**: Evaluates how well the generated answer addresses the original question.

**Process**:
1. Generate an answer to the original question.
2. Create a new question based on the generated answer.
3. Compute embeddings for both the original and new questions.
4. Calculate the cosine similarity between these embeddings.
5. Higher similarity indicates higher answer relevance.

**Flow**:
Question → Generated Answer → Question from Answer → Embedding Computation → Cosine Similarity Calculation → Relevance Assessment

## Implementation

These metrics can be implemented using LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models. LangChain facilitates connection to vector databases like VectorDB for efficient information retrieval and context storage.

By utilizing these RAG metrics, developers can comprehensively evaluate and optimize their retrieval-augmented generation systems, ensuring high-quality, relevant, and faithful responses in various natural language processing applications.
